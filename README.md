# Pablo
Pablo is a autonomus Beach Art rover. The goal is to draw large drawings on the beach.

Before departure, the mission of the rover is prepared in advance by placing the image to be drawn on a map.
Once on the spot, the robot aims to trace the path on the sand with the help of the map, a GNSS receiver and sensors like compass and odometer.

The rover don't need any hardware tags that define the work area, so it can work on large areas.
It is located on the ground knowing its geographical coordinates using its sensors.

Still in development, it can already draw figures. However it still needs to improve accuracy with more sensitive sensors.
